This is an attempt to get a working Crystal icon theme for KDE Plasma 5, by combining/mixing different versions of the Crystal icon theme (that were created for KDE 3 desktop). Personally, I think Crystal is the best ever icon theme for the Linux desktop, and I'd like to be able to continue using it on my KDE Plasma 5 desktop.

Crystal Remix is also available on the KDE Store at: https://store.kde.org/p/1226130/

To install:
- Either install through KDE Plasma (System Settings -> Icons -> Icons -> Get New Icons -> Search for Crystal Remix).
- Or, if install from source, copy the Crystal Remix folder to the system's icon themes folder (e.g. /usr/share/icons). Note that you might have to refresh KDE Plasma 5 icon cache (e.g. running '$ rm ~/.cache/icon-cache.kcache') when you switch to using the new icon theme for the applications to refresh their icons.
