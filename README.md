# Crystal Remix icon theme

[Releases](https://github.com/dangvd/crystal-remix-icon-theme/releases)

Crystal Remix is a Crystal icon theme for modern Linux desktop environments, created by combining/mixing different versions of the Crystal icon theme (that were originally created for KDE 3 desktop). Personally, I think Crystal is the best ever icon theme for the Linux desktop, and I'd like to be able to continue using it.

## License

The original Crystal icon sets were licensed under the LGPL.

## To install:
- Unzip and copy the Crystal Remix directory to an icon theme directory (e.g. /usr/share/icons/ or $HOME/.local/share/icons/) then select Crystal Remix in the icon theme section of the System Settings / Control Panel.
- Alternatively, if your desktop environment supports it, you can also download and install directly from the icon theme section of the System Settings / Control Panel.
